=Welcome to the HEMA Video Wiki= 

A Historical European Western Martial Arts wiki for the study of longsword, sidesword, rapier, greatsword, and other historic weapons.

This wiki has several related goals:

* Create taxonomy systems for discussing fencing techniques
* Make it easier to sharing interpretations of fencing techniques
* Eventually provide material that can be moved into Wiktenauer

This wiki was originally named for [[http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Fechtkunst_Glossary_%28Jeffrey_Forgeng%29|Forgeng's Fechtkunst]], one of the oldest modern glossaries on the study of historic fencing.

=Rules= 

# Only post things that you can link back the sources. For example, a video on the Zornhau is not allowed. A video on Ringeck's Zornhau is ok.
# If a page asks you to log-in, it's blank. Please film a video and post it.
# When creating new pages, try to use the templates so everything looks consistent.
# Ask for help when adding new sources. Not required, but we've got a few tricks to make it go much faster.
