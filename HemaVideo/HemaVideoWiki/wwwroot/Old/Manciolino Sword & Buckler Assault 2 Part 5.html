 <em>Then making a close to the half sword, which is done by throwing a tramazzone that falls into porta di ferro larga, you will immediately advance your left foot forward, extending a thrust to the right side of the face, and as he raises in order to protect himself from the said thrust, taking his sword to the inside with your left hand, you will throw a mandritto to his head or wherever it seems better to you, and thus you will have satisfactorily furnished the play.</em><br />
<br />
<em>But wanting, as is custom, to return gracefully from the play, going with your back to the rear, in such going you will cast your right foot back, throwing a mandritto under-arm. Then similarly retiring your left foot to the rear, you will execute a montante from your left side, and another from your right, in which your sword goes into guardia alta. Then casting your right foot back another time you will throw a mandritto underarm. Then leaning your weight over your fixed feet toward your right side you will throw a riverso so that your sword is turned overhead, lowering that into guardia di Alicorno, which has been described above. Subsequently, casting your left foot back, you will extend a thrust that goes into guardia alta, drawing your right foot near your left, and thus you will be returned to the first place from whence you began to come to the play.</em><br />
