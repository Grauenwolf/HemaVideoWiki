 <em>Then, wanting at last to assault your enemy, you will lead your left foot forward into large pace, throwing a thrust in the gesture of a montante, which goes to end in the face of the enemy, and immediately passing forward with the right foot again into large pace, you will throw a penetrating riverso to the face, redoubling two tramazzoni to the head, so that the last falls into porta di ferro stretta, and you will immediately do a montante into guardia alta, drawing your right foot near your left, and then passing forward with your right foot you will throw an over-arm mandritto, recoiling similarly your right foot near your left.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Then stepping forward with your left, you will do a mezzo riverso to end in guardia di faccia. And pretending to do another riverso, you will carry your right foot forward, giving him moreover a show as if to strike him in the head with a mandritto, and during this show, crossing with your left foot you will stick him in the face with a thrust in the gesture of a montante.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Then, with the right foot forward, you will throw a riverso from low to high, and a mandritto going over your arm, and thereafter casting your right foot behind your left you will deliver a riverso to his sword hand, so that your buckler is a good defender of your head, and that your sword is taken into coda lunga [alta]. Then with your left foot forward you will settle yourself with your sword in guardia di testa, and then passing with your right foot toward his left side, you will throw a fendente to his head, in which tempo your left leg must follow behind your right.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Then you will recover your sword into porta di ferro stretta, going thereafter into guardia di faccia, and from here you will guide your left forward toward his left side, so that your right leg follows behind your left, and having done this you will throw a riverso to his face.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Then you will extend a stoccata, lifting yourself gracefully with a hop backwards, and passing forward from here with your right you will do a montante into guardia alta, and will draw your right foot behind your left, which, having done, you will then embellish the play in the fashion described a little above.</em><br />
