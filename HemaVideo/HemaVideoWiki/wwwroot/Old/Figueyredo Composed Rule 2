=Translation= 
//You will raise the montante// with the point forward in front of the right ear, with the left foot forward. Then you will move the right foot forward, and at the same time you will give a //talho// forward, bringing the //montante// high in front of the face in order to pass it over the head and behind the shoulders, such that it falls over the left arm to give a circling //revez//, and then a //talho// in a manner that you return the //montante// to its position high in front of the face. And from there, first moving the left foot forward, you will give a //revez// forward, ending with the //montante// high with the point forward, and passing it over head you will give a circling //talho// and a //revez//, returning the //montante// to the position in which you began the rule, which you will undo in the following manner: You will first remove the left foot and give a //talho// forward, ending with the //montante// point forward in front of the face, and then a //talho//,[[http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Diogo_Gomes_de_Figueyredo#cite_note-talho-2|[2]]] and a circling //revez//,[[http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Diogo_Gomes_de_Figueyredo#cite_note-talho-2|[2]]] and ending with the //montante// in the same place. Then you will remove the right foot backward with a //revez// forward that will stop with the //montante// high, and then a //talho// and a circling //revez//, replacing the //montante// how it started the rule.
