This play is part of [[Antonio Manciolino]]'s Opera Nova.
=Book 2= 
//And resuming the play with your right foot forward you will throw a fendente to end in guardia di faccia, recoiling your right foot even with your left, and then with your left forward you will throw a tramazzone to the head, and placing your right forward thereafter, you will make a show of turning another tramazzone, but you will strike his leg opposite you with a mandritto instead, so that your sword goes under your arm, and your buckler to the defense of your head. Then you will throw a riverso from low to high to your enemyâ€™s hand, hopping gaily back so that after finishing the leap you will find yourself with even feet in coda lunga alta.//

//Then crossing forward with your right you will do a montante into guardia alta. Then throwing a tramazzone into porta di ferro larga, entirely uncovered, you will remain alert, so that if perchance your enemy wants to strike you in the head, immediately casting your left foot forward and letting your sword go into coda lunga [alta] you will take the said blow with your buckler, and you will respond to him with a falso across his left temple in such a way that your sword goes under your arm.//

//Casting thereafter your left foot behind your right you will throw a riverso to his face, falling into coda lunga so that your head is well guarded by your buckler. Then, with your right foot retired to the rear, you will extend a thrust to his face, and then returning forward with the same right foot you will redouble two tramazzoni upon each other, of which the last falls into porta di ferro stretta, following with a montante into guardia alta, and here for the third time you will embellish the play in the aforesaid fashion.//
