=Translation= 
//You will ready a thrust over the left arm planting the body with the right foot behind, and after removing it while standing still, moving the right foot forward you will give a talho, forming at the end of it another thrust over the right arm. Then you will put in the left foot with a revez, and while standing still you will give another thrust readying it over the left arm (for that is where all those that originate from revezes are formed). You will exit backward with the left foot with a talho, ending it with another thrust, that you will give while standing still (and all those that are formed from talhos are readied over the right arm), and exiting with the right foot you will give a revez, to end with your body as it was at the beginning of the rule.//
