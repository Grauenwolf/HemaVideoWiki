=Translation= 
//This rule is for fighting with people in front and behind; do it by giving a talho// from behind with the opposite foot which is the left, and another forward putting in the right foot, readying a thrust over the right arm which you will give to the rear, removing again the right foot. Then the left foot will go with a //revez//, turning the body towards where you gave the thrust. Next you will give a //talho// forward with the same opposite foot, and another putting in the right foot readying the same thrust, which you will give with the right foot to the rear, and successively a //revez// entering with the left foot, and then the two //talhos// starting again with the opposite foot, all corresponding to the opposition against you.
