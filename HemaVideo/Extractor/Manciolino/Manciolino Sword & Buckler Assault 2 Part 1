This play is part of [[Antonio Manciolino]]'s Opera Nova.
=Book 2= 
//Beginning, therefore, the second assault at its first part, which is going to the play, I say that similarly you will settle yourself in one corner of the room as you did in your previous graceful arrangement, and you will cross toward your right side with your right foot, striking the dome of your buckler with the false edge, and raising your sword into guardia alta, so that your buckler is turned toward your face in the manner of a mirror, and thence you will pass forward with your left foot into large pace, making a great leap toward your enemy, in which tempo your sword must make a tramazzone into porta di ferro stretta, and thus you will abide with your feet even.//

//Then you will immediately cross forward with your right foot into large pace, making a montante into guardia alta, and here you will embellish the play, not in the fashion in which you did in the first assault, for each of these three assaults has separated its embellishment, which it pleases us to name thus, and for the entirety of the play in which it is found, from the beginning, it is licit to speak of again.//

//The embellishing of this second assault will be, accordingly, that cutting with a fendente to the edge of your buckler which falls into cingiara porta di ferro, and throwing the right foot to the rear in the same tempo, you will retreat with your left foot behind your right, and therewith you will strike the dome of your buckler. Then you will do a montante that ends in guardia alta, drawing your right foot even with your left.//
