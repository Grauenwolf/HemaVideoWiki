=Translation= 
//You will place the body with the left foot forward, and give a talho from behind while standing still and another forwards putting in the right foot, readying a thrust over the right arm, which you will give while standing still. Then you will put in the left foot with a revez, and removing backward this same left foot with a talho, you will ready another thrust that you will give while standing still, and removing backward the right foot you will give a revez to end in the state in which you began the rule.//
