This play is part of [[fechtkunst/Diogo Gomes de Figueyredo|Diogo Gomes de Figueyredo]]'s Memorial / Of the Practice of the Montante.
=Translation= 
//This rule is called Guarding a Lady, presuming that she hides behind your shoulders, and you wish to defend her. You will place the body square with the compass of the feet a little wide, and you will give a talho moving the left foot one palm width forward, looking in the direction the montante goes, and stopping with in front of the face; and you will give a revez moving the right foot the same way, and a talho moving the left foot, and then a revez moving the right foot according to the same theory. Then you will give a talho while standing still and a revez removing the right foot, and a talho removing the left foot, and another revez removing the right foot. Here could come into play the two talhos and two revezes that are given while standing still and with the left arm held firmly against the body, which are commonly called Fly-Swatter and belong to the thirteenth composed rule.//
