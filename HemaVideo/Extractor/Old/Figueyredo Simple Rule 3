=Translation= 
//You will place the body with the left foot forward, and give a talho from behind while standing still, and another forward putting in the right foot; then a revez from behind while standing still, and another forward putting in the left foot. You will undo the rule with a talho from behind while standing still, and another forward removing the same left foot, and then a revez from behind while standing still, and another forward removing the right foot, to end how you began the rule.//
