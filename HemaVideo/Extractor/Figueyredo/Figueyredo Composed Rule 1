This play is part of [[fechtkunst/Diogo Gomes de Figueyredo|Diogo Gomes de Figueyredo]]'s Memorial / Of the Practice of the Montante.
=Translation= 
//All the composed rules are counterpoint to the simple, and these the basis of the composed. And thus, planting the body with the left foot forward, you will give a talho// from low to high, which will be accompanied forward by the right foot, stopping with the //montante// in font of the face. Then you will let fall the //montante// to the right to give an //altibaxo// putting in the left foot, and from where the //montante// comes to a stop you will give a //talho// from low to high accompanied by the right foot which you will move forward, stopping with the //montante// in front of the face. And then you will give a //revez// from low to high accompanied by the left foot which you will move forward, stopping with the //montante// in front of the face. Then you will let fall the //montante// to the left crossing the right arm over the left, and you will give an //altibaxo revez// moving the right foot forward, and from where the //montante// comes to a stop you will give a //revez// from low to high accompanied by the left foot which you will move forward, and stop with the //montante// in front of the face. Next, you will undo this rule with the same blows, actions, and steps, retreating backward until you place your body as it began the rule.
